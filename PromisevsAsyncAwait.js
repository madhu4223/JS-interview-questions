// - Promise is an object representing intermediate state of operation which is guaranteed to complete its execution at some point in future.
// - Async/Await is a syntactic sugar for promises, a wrapper making the code execute more synchronously.

//  - Promise has 3 states â€“ resolved, rejected and pending.
//  - It does not have any states. It returns a promise either resolved or rejected.

// - Error handling is done using .then() and .catch() methods.
//  - Error handling is done using try() and catch() methods.

//  -  Promise chains can become difficult to understand sometimes.
//  - Using Async/Await makes it easier to read and understand the flow of the program as compared to promise chains.
