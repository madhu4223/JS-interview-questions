// Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction

//Abstraction
// Hides complexity from users and only shows relevant information. For example, a car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.
// Encapsulation
// Protects data stored in a class from system-wide access.
// Inheritance
// Allows a child class to inherit the fields and methods of the parent class.
// Polymorphism
// Allows performing a certain action in different ways. For example, objects of different classes can perform actions with the same name using different code.
