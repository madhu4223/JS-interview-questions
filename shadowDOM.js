// what is shadow DOM

// Hey there! Imagine you're building a cool LEGO castle, and you want to make a special hidden room that only you can see and play with. Even though the whole castle is in your room, this secret room is hidden and separate from the rest of the castle. It has its own little world inside, and nobody can mess with it unless you let them.

// In the world of computers and websites, the **Shadow DOM** is like that hidden LEGO room. It's a way to create a separate part of a website that can have its own special rules and designs. When you're making a website using React (which is like building with digital LEGOs), you sometimes need a special place where the things you build won't get mixed up with everything else on the page. This helps keep everything neat and organized.

// So, the Shadow DOM is like a secret hideout in a website where things can be different and protected, making it easier to build and manage cool, complex things without getting everything all jumbled up!


// Ex; creating a div programatically (document.createElement) and adding stying to it, so this div is from shadow DOM which is isolated from rest of the project.
//  styles from rest of the project will not affect this. it's like attaching a hidden DOM tree to an element in the regular DOM tree
