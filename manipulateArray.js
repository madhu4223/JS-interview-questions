// [1,2,3,4,5] [1] when we return the arr from function we are not storing that arr in (manipulateArray (list)) in any variable and 
// when we trying to console list we get modified array because in function we passing that array reference as 
// argument (pass by reference) i.e [1,2,3,4,5,5] and send time when we trying to console the list modified with return array from 
// function and we are storing in variable and we get [1].
